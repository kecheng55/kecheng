## Introduction

Welcome to my personal research website! I am thrilled to share with you my passion for scientific exploration and discovery. Here, you will find a window into the world of research that has fueled my curiosity and led me on a journey to unravel the mysteries of the universe.

## About Me

I am a committed researcher with a background encompassing chemical biology, medicinal chemistry, and nanomedicine. My odyssey in the world of science commenced with the development of tetrazole-based drugs via chemoproteomics. Since then, I have been on an unwavering mission to expand the horizons of human understanding, conducting one experiment at a time.

## Research Interests

My research interests are broad, spanning the domains of chemistry and biology. I am particularly captivated by the creation of innovative chemical methodologies, the development of functional small-molecule probes, and the exploration of self-assembling nanomaterials. My endeavors in these domains aim to advance drug discovery and explore diverse therapeutic avenues. I take pride in my contributions to the scientific community, as highlighted in the  [**publications**](https://chengresearch.com/#featured)

## Collaborations

Collaboration is the heart of scientific progress. I am fortunate to collaborate with talented researchers and institutions around the world. Together, we endeavor to address some of the most pressing inquiries and pioneer meaningful progress. I extend an invitation to connect with me and engage in discussions regarding our shared scientific interests. Please don't hesitate to reach out via [**email**](mailto:ke.cheng@my.cityu.edu.hk) or connect with me on [twitter](www.twitter.com/kecheng55).


## Closing Remarks:

Thank you for visiting my research website and taking the time to explore my scientific journey. I am excited to continue pushing the boundaries of what we know and uncovering the mysteries that lie ahead. Together, we can embark on an exhilarating voyage of exploration and innovation. **Stay curious!**
