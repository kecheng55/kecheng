TI  - Identification of SIRT3 as an eraser of H4K16la.
LID - 107757
AB  - Lysine lactylation (Kla) is a novel histone post-translational modification 
      discovered in late 2019. Later, HDAC1-3, were identified as the robust Kla 
      erasers. While the Sirtuin family proteins showed weak eraser activities toward 
      Kla, as reported. However, the catalytic mechanisms and physiological functions 
      of HDACs and Sirtuins are not identical. In this study, we observed that SIRT3 
      exhibits a higher eraser activity against the H4K16la site than the other human 
      Sirtuins. Crystal structures revealed the detailed binding mechanisms between 
      lactyl-lysine peptides and SIRT3. Furthermore, a chemical probe, p-H4K16laAlk, 
      was developed to capture potential Kla erasers from cell lysates. SIRT3 was 
      captured by this probe and detected via proteomic analysis. And another chemical 
      probe, p-H4K16la-NBD, was developed to detect the eraser-Kla delactylation 
      processes directly via fluorescence indication. Our findings and chemical probes 
      provide new directions for further investigating Kla and its roles in gene 
      transcription regulation.

OAB - • SIRT3 shows a preference for delactylating H4K16 site compared to other 
      Sirtuins. • Crystal structures revealed the binding details between lactyl-motif 
      and SIRT3. • The probe with clickable photo-cross-linker captured SIRT3 from cell 
      lysates. • The fluorogenic probe can be used to monitor the delactylation 
      processes directly.
