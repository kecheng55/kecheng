abstract: Stem cell transplantation holds great potential as a treatment option for nerve damage diseases. However, the therapeutic effects are significantly impeded by low survival rate and uncontrolled differentiation of stem cells. In this study, black phosphorus nanosheets (BPNs), which are biodegradable inorganic nanomaterials, are first revealed with remarkable abilities to regulate cellular redox homeostasis, enhance transplant survival rate of stem cells, and facilitate neural differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPCs). These effects of BPNs are proved to be associated with the activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2-like 2 (Nrf2) pathways in NPCs. In vivo, BPNs-treated NPCs could effectively inhibit inflammatory response and neuronal apoptosis in the mice with spinal cord injury (SCI). In addition, BPNs-treated NPCs more effectively reduce glial scar formation and promote axon regeneration compared with natural NPCs in SCI site. These findings collectively support the therapeutic potentials of BPNs for advanced stem cell transplantation and neural tissue engineering in the future.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary:  we report that the direct treatment of BPNs can improve the survival rate of NPCs and enhance the neural differentiation of NPCs. These biological effects of BPNs on NPCs are comprehensively demonstrated and can be primarily attribute to the up-regulation of Nrf2 in NPCs induced by BPNs. In SCI mice, BPNs are demonstrated with enhanced neuroprotection to NPCs. BPNs-treated NPCs effectively reduce glial scar formation and promote axon regeneration, demonstrating a better nerve repair effect. Our proposed biodegradable BPNs-based stem cell therapy provides more informative support for improving the efficacy of stem cell transplantation for nerve damage diseases
