abstract  ="An ultra-sensitive and ratiometric fluorescent probe for hypochlorous acid (HOCl) detection based on the mechanism of aggregation induced emission (AIE) and through-bond energy transfer (TBET) has been reported herein. By exploiting the advantages of AIE and TBET{,} which eliminates emission leakage from dark donors{,} the probe exhibits ultra-high sensitivity towards HOCl by an enhancement of over 7000-fold in the fluorescence ratio (I589 nm/I477 nm){,} which is one of the highest recorded so far. The reaction mechanism has been discussed in detail{,} and the effects of interferents and the reaction kinetics have also been investigated. Lastly{,} the successful result of exogenous/endogenous HOCl imaging detection in different cell lines indicates the potential use of the probe in living systems."}
