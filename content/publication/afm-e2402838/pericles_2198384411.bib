abstract = {Abstract Chemoselective modification of specific residues within a given protein poses a significant challenge, as the microenvironment of amino acid residues in proteins is variable. Developing a universal molecular platform with tunable chemical warheads can provide powerful tools for precisely labeling specific amino acids in proteins. Cysteine and lysine are hot targets for chemoselective modification, but current cysteine/lysine-selective warheads face challenges due to cross-reactivity and unstable reaction products. In this study, a versatile fluorescent platform is developed for highly selective modification of cysteine/lysine under biocompatible conditions. Chloro- or phenoxy-substituted NBSe derivatives effectively labeled cysteine residues in the cellular proteome with high specificity. This finding also led to the development of phenoxy-NBSe phototheragnostic for the diagnosis and activatable photodynamic therapy of GSH-overexpressed cancer cells. Conversely, alkoxy-NBSe derivatives are engineered to selectively react with lysine residues in the cellular environment, exhibiting excellent anti-interfering ability against thiols. Leveraging a proximity-driven approach, alkoxy-NBSe probes are successfully designed to demonstrate their utility in bioimaging of lysine deacetylase activity. This study also achieves integrating a small photosensitizer into lysine residues of proteins in a regioselective manner, achieving photoablation of cancer cells activated by overexpressed proteins.},
