abstract = {Abstract Target-identification phenotypic screening has been a powerful approach in drug discovery; however, it is hindered by difficulties in identifying the underlying cellular targets. To address this challenge, we have combined phenotypic screening of a fully functionalized small-molecule library with competitive affinity-based proteome profiling to map and functionally characterize the targets of screening hits. Using this approach, we identified ANXA2, PDIA3/4, FLAD1, and NOS2 as primary cellular targets of two bioactive molecules that inhibit cancer cell proliferation. We further demonstrated that a panel of probes can label and/or image annexin A2 (a cancer biomarker) from different cancer cell lines, thus providing opportunities for potential cancer diagnosis and therapy.},
