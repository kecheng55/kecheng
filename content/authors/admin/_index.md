I am a chemical biologist with a strong focus on leveraging organic chemical tools and strategies to drive small-molecule drug discovery and expand therapeutic possibilities. My research centers on using chemical groups such as tetrazole, isoxazole, and trioxolane to develop photoaffinity probes for high-throughput screening of novel drug candidates and direct profiling of cellular druggable targets through chemoproteomics. I also have extensive experience in designing activatable chemical probes, fluorescent probes, prodrugs, and radioligand agents for targeted cancer treatment. Additionally, I am deeply interested in applying small-molecule probes and inorganic nanomaterials to engineer nanomedicines for precise cancer therapeutics.
