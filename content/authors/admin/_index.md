My research focuses on using new chemical approaches to advance drug discovery and therapeutic options. I have developed tetrazole and isoxazole as native photo-cross-linkers for chemoproteomics, offering direct interactome mapping methods for tetrazole/isoxazole drug development. I am also passionate about crafting small-molecule probes/inorganic nanomaterials for precise, targeted cancer theranostics.
